1. - Component-based architecture
   - Virtual DOM
   - Javascripy Syntax Extension (JSX)
   - One-way data flow
   - Performance

2. - React's component-based architecture makes it easy to test individual components in isolation, which simplifies the testing process and ensures that components are functioning as expected.
   - React allows developers to create reusable UI components that can be used across multiple applications. This not only saves time but also improves the consistency and maintainability of the code.
   - React uses a virtual DOM, which allows React to update only the necessary parts of the DOM, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance.
   - React can be used to build native mobile applications using React Native. This allows developers to use the same codebase to build both web and mobile applications, saving time and effort.
   - React has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, share knowledge, and create tools and libraries that extend its functionality.

3. - React was created by Jordan Walke and is now owned and maintained by Facebook

4. - HTML has a simple syntax that uses tags and attributes to define elements, while JSX uses a combination of HTML-like syntax and JavaScript expressions to create elements.
   - JSX is typically used with React while HTML can be used with any framework or library, but it doesn't have a built-in component-based architecture.
   - Because JSX is often used with React, it comes with a range of tooling and libraries that are not available with HTML. For example, tools like Babel can be used to transpile JSX code to JavaScript, and libraries like React Router to manage routing in your application.

5. This is because browsers cannot read JSX directly because JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, and browsers can only read and execute JavaScript code.
